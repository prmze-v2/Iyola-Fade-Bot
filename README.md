# Iyola-Fade-Bot
A basic ass gradient bot written in go.

I wrote this bot in under an hour, so please excuse any mistakes with spelling/grammar etc. DM Me with any problems.

The bot uses a MySQL Database to auth users so make sure to set that up, the sql file with all the shit inside is contained in auth.sql.

If you want to add a user it is very simple. Get their user id and insert it into the MySQL database with

```
INSERT INTO `id` (`fade`) VALUES ('discorduseridhere');
```

It is that simple, any questions shoot me a dm on insta: https://instagram.com/prmze/ and enjoy!

THIS BOT MAY NOT BE USED TO GAIN ANY MONEY OFF OF ANYONE AND IF PEOPLE ARE USING THIS BOT TO PROFIT THEMSELVES THEN PLEASE LET ME KNOW BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WHAT THE BOT WAS CREATED FOR! IF YOU NEED PROOF THAT ITS MINE JUST TYPE e.g. "!credits" AND IT WILL SHOW THE BOT CREDITS!!!!!! REPLACE "!" WITH THE PREFIX LOL.
